WorldStage Newsonline– The Federal Government of Nigeria has confirmed that only N216.66 billion out of a projected N807.57 billion revenues from Government Owned Enterprises (GOEs) and revenue generating agencies was realized in 2017. Director General, Budget Office of the Federation, Ben Akabueze who stated this during a Town hall presentation of ‘Revenue Performance Frame Work for GOEs’ with the Chief Executive Officers of GOEs in Abuja  lamented that despite the huge sum of N40 trillion invested in the agencies, remittance to the treasury in terms of dividend or surplus at the end of each operating year was mostly insignificant. He said, “The record shows that few of the GOEs declare surpluses. In effect, the Nigerian tax payers and general public have not benefited much from these investments. “Remittances and collections by Government agencies should contribute more significantly to FGN’s revenue. “The expected outcome will be significantly improved remittances by revenue-generating and collecting agencies in order to strengthen the Federal Government’s finances.” Giving an historical revenue performance of the federation account inflow for 2015-2016, Akabueze said, out of a total projected sum of N847.95 billion independent revenues in 2018, only N302.66 billion, representing 36% was remitted by GOEs, “In 2016, N1, 505.88 billion independent revenues, only N389.19 billion, representing 26.4% was remitted by GOEs; while in 2015, N489.29billion Independent revenues, only N302.66billion, representing 72% were remitted by GOEs,” he said. Akabueze, noted that Nigeria faced significant medium term fiscal challenges especially with revenue generation, and  that Nigeria had no problem with debt but generating revenue. “Achieving fiscal sustainability and macro-fiscal objectives of government will require bold, decisive and urgent action”, he said.
