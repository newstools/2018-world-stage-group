The Nigerian Army has disbursed N19 million to 95 widows of fallen heroes residing in Abakpa and Awkunanaw Barracks in Enugu State to ameliorate the hardship being faced by the women. Maj.- Gen. Adamu Abubakar, the General Officer Commanding (GOC), 82 Division of the Nigerian Army said this in a statement issued by Col. Sagir Musa, Deputy Director of Army Public Relations of the Division on Saturday in Enugu. Musa, who explained that each of the widows received N200, 000, said that the money was presented to the widows at the divisionâ€™s auditorium in Enugu on Friday. He said that Abubakar, on behalf of the Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Tukur Buratai, urged the beneficiaries to make use of the money judiciously. Musa also said that the GOC thanked Gov. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi for his continuous support to the widows and the Division. Ugwuanyi had during the 2018 Armed Forces Remembrance Day Celebration pledged to empower the widows of fallen heroes of the Division. The governor on Feb. 17, during the 2018 West African Social Activities (WASA) held in Abakpa Cantonment, Enugu, redeemed the pledge with a cheque of N19.6 million, which he presented to the GOC. Musa also said that the Garrison Commander of the Division, Brig.-Gen. Lasisi Adegboye, and representatives from the Nigeria Army Officers Wives Association (NAOWA), 82 Division Chapter attended the occasion.
