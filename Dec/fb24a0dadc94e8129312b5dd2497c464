WorldStage Newsonline— The Speaker of the House of Representatives Yakubu Dogara has described as covert direct vote buying the on-going Trader Moni Scheme being operated by the federal government. He therefore called on all Nigerians to rise and condemn all practices of vote buying as, according to him, it is the worst form of corruption and should be treated as such. The Trader Moni initiative is a no-interest N10,000 loan to petty traders across the country. However, while speaking at the one day ‘Public Hearing on Vote Buying and Improving Electoral Processes in Nigeria’, on Monday, in Abuja, Dogara said: “the development is disheartening. “I am delighted to address you on this public hearing, this is one of the important issue of the moment that needs to be addressed before the 2019 general elections,” Dogara said. “For election to be qualified under a Democratic Government as free, fair and credible, it must be devoid of any trace of sharp and manipulative practice. “The recent phenomenal and direct buying of vote is very disheartening. As citizens, we must not surrender to this criminality. “Vote Buying and other criminal electoral process has left our citizen in a disaster because they are ruled by fear rather than challenging them. “I call on all Nigerians to rise and condemn all practices of Vote Buying as it is the worst form of corruption and should be treated as such.”
