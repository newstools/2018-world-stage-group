No fewer than 40 new medical doctors  have been absorbed into Kebbi state civil service from the Usmanu Danfodio University, Sokoto, Sudan and Indian universities. A statement by the Chief Press Secretary to Gov. Atiku Bagudu, Alhaji Muazu Dakingari on Tuesday in Kebbi, said the new doctors have been automatically absorbed into the state civil service. He said that the state government had distributed 40 laptops computers to them to serve as a source of motivation to them.

He said that the training and retraining of those in service would also be sustained. “The government has begun searching for English speaking University in China where students of the state could be sent to study in pursuance of quality education,” he said.
