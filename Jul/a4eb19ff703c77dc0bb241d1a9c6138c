The Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN) has said that 33,974 rice farmers will  benefit from the CBN Anchors Borrowers loan  in Zamfara state. Chairman of the association Alhaji Isyaku Ajiya-Anka said the farmers were identified  during the biometric data capturing exercise in the state. Ajiya said each farmer would received one pumping machine,  30 kilograms of rice seedlings and six bags of fertiliser. The total loan package is N219, 329.50 per hectare. As part of the package, the farmers will  receive herbicide, pesticide,   farming services, which included ploughing, harrowing, planting and harvesting. Ajiya-Anka said the farmers would not get the cash directly. For farmers who do not require all the services,  the cost of services not required will be used to offset part of the loan. State Coordinator CBN Anchor Borrowers , Aliyu Hafiz said every farmer has a card which contains all his details and the required quantities of inputs he should be given. He said the distribution of the inputs has begun in  seven local government areas of the state. The councils are  Gusau, Bungudu, Gummi, Bakura, Anka, Kaura Namoda and Talata Mafara.
