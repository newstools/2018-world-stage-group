WorldStage Newsonline– FCMB Group has announced its second quarter (Q2) 2018 results with profit before tax (PBT) growth of 109% to N3.8 billion when compared with Q2 2017, while profit after tax (PAT) after minority interest grew by 74.5% to N2.428 billion. The strong earnings growth was driven by a 59% growth in non-interest income and a -51% reduction in loan loss provisions. The growth in non-interest income was underpinned by strong growth in fx trading income and fees generated from card services. The slower growth in PAT relative to PBT was due to a combination of a 76% spike in income tax expense and a negative result of –N677m in other comprehensive income (OCI) against -46% Q2 2017.
