WorldStage Newsonline--- It was a night of excitement for fun lovers who were at a concert in Abuja on Saturday where popularly Nigerian musicians such as Flavour, Styl Plus, Tekno and others thrilled them with great performances. The event, the first of its kind in the city attracted over  1000 fans into the Congress hall of  Transcorp Hilton. Styl-Plus first graced the stage with performances that rolled back the years. The  music group performed different hits including, “Olufunmi” and “Imagine that” from the Expressions album and “four years” from the Back and Better album much to the delight of the Abuja crowd. One of the members of the group popularly known as Shifi, revealed his excitement. He said “It is always great to perform in Abuja because this is home. This is where it all began”. Flavour N’abania took his chance to excite the crowd with his performance and did not disappoint. The “Ada Ada” crooner got many people up and dancing to his popular tunes. A fan who revealed her name as Isioma Okolo said she was excited watching one of her favourite artists perform. She said “My favourite Nigerian musician has done it again, I have been to some of his shows before and he raises the bar every time”.
