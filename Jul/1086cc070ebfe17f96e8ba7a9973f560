In continuation of its youth engagement program in tertiary institutions across the country, Ecobank will tomorrow (Friday) storm the premier university, University of Ibadan, Oyo State with Ecobank Xpress Account Concert. In a statement signed by Ikechukwu Kalu, Head, Consumer Marketing, Insights & Analytics, Ecobank Nigeria, the campus concert which  kicks off at 4pm at the Student Union building sports complex, will feature a popular hip hop artiste,  Slimcase, with celebrity guest appearance by Toyin Aimakhu. Kalu also stated that various prizes ranging from laptops, tablets and fridges, among others have been lined up for grabs by winners in the various competitions at the event. “This is one concert students and youths around the campus must not miss. It promises to be fun and excitement all the way and besides, many of the attendees will be going home with various gifts,” . It would be recalled that Ecobank recently flagged off an initiative, themed ‘Ecobank Xpress Campus Storm’ to avail students of tertiary institutions the opportunity to open the Ecobank Xpress account, a digital account that requires no documentation, minimum balance or paperwork, simply by downloading the Ecobank Mobile app. With the Ecobank Xpress account, students will be able to access financial services such as airtime top up, funds transfer and bills payment from their mobile devices. Parents and Guardians will also be able to transfer money to their children or wards‘ Xpress accounts which they can withdraw from without a card at any Ecobank ATM or Xpress Point. The first phase of this initiative will cover 24 universities, polytechnics and colleagues of education across the country.  So far, the Campus Storm team has visited University of Lagos, University of Benin, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife and others.
