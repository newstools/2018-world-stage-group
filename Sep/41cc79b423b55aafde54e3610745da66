WorldStage Newsonline–  The 36 states in Nigeria are set to receive the remaining 50 per cent part of the Paris Club Refund from the Federal Government when they meet the conditions set for disbursement. The Federal Ministry of Finance in a statement on Tuesday listed the conditions agreed on during a Debt Management Office (DMO) led reconciliation process under the supervision of the Federal Ministry of Finance for the final approval of US$2.689 billion to the states. The conditions include, Salary and staff related arrears must be paid as a priority; Commitment to the commencement of the repayment of Budget Support Loans granted in 2016, to be made by all States; Clearing of amounts due to the Presidential Fertiliser Initiative; Commitment to clear matching grants from the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) where some States have available funds which could be used to improve primary education and learning outcomes. According to the statement, the payment of the approved amount would be made in phased tranches to the States. The issue of Paris Club loan over-deduction had been a long standing dispute between the Federal Government and the State Governments which dated back to the period of 1995 to 2002. In response to the dispute, President Muhammadu Buhari directed that the claims of over-deduction should be formally and individually reconciled by the Debt Management Office (DMO). This reconciliation commenced in November 2016. As an interim measure to alleviate the financial challenges of the States during the 2016 recession, the President had approved that fifty percent (50%) of the amounts claimed by States be paid to enable the States clear salary and pension arrears. This was released between 1st December, 2016 and 29th September, 2017. This refund was part of the Government’s fiscal stimulus to ensure the financial health of Sub-National Governments.
