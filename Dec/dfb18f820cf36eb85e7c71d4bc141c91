WorldStage Newsonline— In spite of being a member of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Senator representing Benue North-East Senatorial District at the National Assembly Abuja, Barnabas Gemade, has said he’s supporting the re-election bid of Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) come  2019. Gemade, presently the senatorial candidate under the platform of SDP in his constituency for the 2019 elections made this known at a meeting he held with political leaders of Kwande Local Government Area at the Makurdi residence of Elder Jonathan Ichaver. It was gathered that the visibly angry Gemade had lambasted the national leadership of the SDP, accusing it of excessive greed. He condemned the state chapter of the party for allowing relatively unknown stranger to purchase the governorship ticket from the legitimate candidate. He said, “As a Leader of SDP in Benue state, I cannot at present say who the governorship candidate of the party is. So, my support in next year’s election for the position of governor is for the incumbent, Governor Samuel Orto.” Ortom belongs to the main opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Gemade described Governor Ortom as his personal friend saying that he does not have issues with him, but that he had to leave PDP due to what he described as irreconcilable differences with the party’s leadership. The meeting was attended by prominent political leaders of Kwande extraction.
