WorldStage Newsonline– Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai on Friday, signed the 2019 budget of N157.449 billion into law for the fiscal year. The governor had in August this year  presented the  budget tagged: “Budget Of Continuity” to Kaduna State House of Assembly for  scrutiny and passage.

He explained that the budget was slightly bigger than the proposed budget of N155.86bn but retained the 60:40 capital to recurrent ratio. This, the governor added, reflected his administration’s commitment to human capital development, noting that education had a capital budget of N25.4bn. He said the programme to improve infrastructure in the education sector was hampered by the irresponsible denial at the Senate of the $350m soughted by the state. “But we soldier on with the resources we have,” adding that “I am happy to report that we have completed the recruitment of 25,000 new primary school teachers. We are now recruiting 7600 teachers for the public secondary schools” “The approved budget size for 2019 is N157.449bn. The capital component is N94.47bn, while recurrent expenditure is N62.97bn. The budget is slightly bigger than the proposed 2019 Budget of N155.86bn but it retains the 60:40 capital to recurrent ratio” “Reflecting our commitment to human capital development, the Social Sector, including Education and Health takes up N39.14bn or 41% of the N94bn capital budget. Education has a capital budget of N25.4bn, while Health has N13.1bn, a concrete demonstration of our desire to promote equality of opportunity by putting people first” he declared. The governor commended the State House of Assembly for the collaborative partnership, saying that “a new tradition has now been established to pass and sign state budget in the preceding year.” He added, “In 2019, for the fourth straight year, the new financial year for the Kaduna State Government will begin on the first day of January. “Today, this alignment of the fiscal and calendar year for the budget of the state government is being extended to the budget of the 23 local government councils in the state. “For the first time in the history of Kaduna State, we are signing the annual budgets for the state government and the 23 local government councils on the same date. “This means that our local government councils will, for the first time since their creation in 1976, also begin the financial year on the first day of the new year.” The speaker of the Kaduna State House of Assembly, Aminu Shagali, represented by his Deputy, Nuhu Shadalafiya, said the legislative arm of government would continue to with other armels of government for the development of the state.
