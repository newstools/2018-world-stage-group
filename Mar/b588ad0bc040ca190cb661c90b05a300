WorldStageNewsonlene--- The Wife of the President, Hajiya Aisha Buhari, National Assembly members and other 3,000 delegates will converge at the All Nigerian Women Leaders Conference on Peace Building and Conflict Resolution on Monday, March 19 in Abuja. Mrs Nma Love Onyechere, Executive Secretary, Centre for Gender Studies International, made this known in a statement on Monday in Abuja. She said that the four days conference will hold from March 19 to March 22 at the Shehu Musa Yar’Adua Centre. She said that the conference with the theme: “Peace in Nigeria; A Collective Responsibility,” is organised by the Centre for Gender Studies International in collaboration with the National Orientation Agency (NOA). According to her, the conference is for Nigerian women to critically discuss the way forward to ensuring peace in the country. Onyechere said women’s equal participation in peace processes is an essential ingredient for lasting peace and true reconciliations. She added that the conference was a practical step to mobilise and educate Nigerian women to join efforts at all levels to support the peace process of government at all levels. Onyechere noted that it was also a platform for women to speak out against the unfortunate circumstances of insecurity and violence in Nigeria. “As mothers of this nation, the call for women to get involved to ensure peace and stability of the country cannot be over emphasised. “This is because women play particular roles in peace process, building, reconciliation as and in fact the worst victims of every conflict and violent situations. “To this effect, women should be aware of the positive and negative influences they have on the misbehavior of their family members and the larger community in which they live. “The maintenance of peace and stability of this nation cannot be fully realised without fully understanding the impact of armed conflicts, incessant killings, abductions and maiming going on in the country,” she said.(NAN)
