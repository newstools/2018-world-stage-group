WorldStage Newsonline– Ecobank Nigeria has reacted to a report that the Honeywell Group had filed a suit claiming N72 billion damages against it, saying it will continue to strongly resist any attempt to use a claim to derail it from recovery of monies owed and overdue for payment. A statement by Adenike Laoye, Company Secretary/Chief Legal Counsel, Ecobank Nigeria Limited said, “We wish to state that Ecobank is unhindered by the continued attempts to coerce the public into believing  that the Honeywell Group has fully paid its overdue  indebtedness. “It is noteworthy that Honeywell’s recent claim for damages was published and serialised in the news media even before the bank was served with the court papers, which clearly elicits the ‘motive’ of a party owing huge sums of money.  Indeed the purport of the matter is most curious especially as there are other pending matters in court which remain undecided.” The Pan African bank with representation across 36 countries said as a responsible corporate citizen,  it will allow due process to prevail in court. “Our resolve is to fight to ensure that debtors fully honour their obligations after benefiting from credit facilities which helped to grow their businesses,” it said.
