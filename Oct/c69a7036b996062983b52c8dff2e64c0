Mrs Ibukun Awosika, the Chairman, Board of Directors of First Bank Plc, has urged Nigerian youths to be self-reliant and be optimistic in overcoming challenges of life. She made the call at a workshop organised by the bank for students of Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) on Friday in Ile-Ife, Osun. While narrating her life experiences and how she climbed the ladder of success, Awosika advised youths to be prepared to be champions in any given society they might find themselves. She said that “the struggle of man which begins at birth is a necessity for every individual to face. “Every human must be determined to weather the storm of life, if success is desired. “Students should think of what they can do for Nigeria, rather than wait for what Nigeria can do for them because the country is a land of opportunities, despite all odds. “Our students should not allow the challenges of the nation to dampen their morale, rather, they should see themselves as one of those who will impact positively on the nation.” According to her, when the society changes for the better, the outcome will result in emergence of good leaders who will take the nation to greater height. The bank chairman, business magnate, author and motivational speaker says “if every Nigerian is good, we won’t produce bad leaders” and urged the students to believe in themselves and be patriotic. She added that “every season is different in life and you can only succeed during your own season because it has its own time. “Ask yourselves as youths, how prepared are you to make your own impact during your season?. “You are accountable adults at this stage. Be old enough to discipline yourselves,” she counselled. Awosike also advised the students not to do what they wanted if left in an open ended setting, stressing that what they did would hunt them one day.
