WorldStage Newsonline– Against the backdrop of three persons killed at a railway crossing in Lagos on Friday, the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) on Sunday warned members of the public and traders in particular, against encroaching on rail tracks while doing their businesses to avert accidents. The three persons were killed while many others sustained injuries after a train hit a commercial bus at Pen Cinema railway crossing. According to a statement, Mr Jerry Oche, NRC Lagos District Manager, said it was regrettable that people had refused to heed the corporation’s warnings on the dangers of trading or driving carelessly on rail tracks. “The railway tracks are not walkways nor parking lots, or market space for trading. “People have no business being on the tracks unless they are railway staff on the track for maintenance.’’ He said that some people have been killed on the tracks because they put on their earpiece and could not hear the train honk. “It is dangerous for anyone to walk on the train tracks with an earpiece. “Despite our warnings, people still walk with earpiece, trading and some driving carelessly on rail tracks knowing very well that trains have the right of way on the tracks,’’ the district manager said.
