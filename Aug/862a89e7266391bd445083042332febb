WorldStage Newsonline–  A total of 252 Special advisers and Special assistants appointed by Gov. Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto state have resigned  their appointments following his recent defection from the All Progressives Congress to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Alhaji Ibrahim Haske, a special adviser to the governor and  spokesman for all the aides said  at a news conference  in Sokoto on Sunday that they have returned to the APC, instead of working under a PDP government. He said “Our appointment is based on the position that APC is the political party governing the state and now that the government belongs to PDP, we have no option other than to resign. “We are bonafide members of APC and our position has always remained same; we therefore resign voluntarily from the PDP government .” Haske, who was a former Sokoto South Local Government Chairman, further explained the decision was based on their desire to support APC to deliver on its mandate  after the  2019 general elections. Alhaji Abdullahi Sokoto, also a special adviser to Tambuwal,  restated the  former aides’  commitment and dedication toward ensuring the success of APC across the state. “We will continue to remain in our party APC and as such we sacrifice our political appointments to clarify people’s doubt and show our stand on party supremacy.” He restated the group’s loyalty and support to the policies and programme of the Federal Government under President Muhammadu Buhari and the leadership of APC. In his reaction, the APC Chairman in the state, Alhaji Sadiq Achida, commended the former aides  to  Gov. Tambuwal for their demonstration of  loyalty to the party. He said, “the sacrifice of the Special advisers is highly recommended and will surely be rewarded by the people and APC in future.”
