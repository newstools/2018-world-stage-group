The Lagos State Government is exploring ways to ease movement of agricultural products in and out of the commercial centre. The state Commissioner for Transportation, Mr Ladi Lawanson, gave the assurance in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos. Lawanson said that the government had intiated a multi-model integrated transport system to achieve the aim. “About a week ago, our governor met with the minister of transport and an agreement was reached that the Lagos end of the rail system by Federal Government will terminate at the ports. “This simply means that there will be free movement of goods from the ports down to the Lagos end and then to other parts of the country. “We also have an inter-state bus system, which is just a step behind the launching of the bus reform system in which a lot of movement from Lagos to other parts of the country will be done,’’ he said. Lawanson told NAN that the bus reform system situated an inter-state house in Ojota area of the state. “The third leg of the multi-model transport system which we launched about a week ago, is water transportation. “We are engaging stakeholders such as the Nigerian Ports Authority and the Nigeria Customs Service. “Movement to bring goods quickly into Lagos and out of Lagos is important,’’ the commissioner said. He said that the government was determined to improve its road and water transport system for the wellbeing of the state residents. NAN reports that Lagos State is estimated to have daily consumption of food amounting to billions of Naira. This makes effective transport system compelling
