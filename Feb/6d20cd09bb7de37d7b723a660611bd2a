WorldStage Newsonline--- As part of efforts to ensure victory for the  Super Eagles  in the 2018 World Cup in Russia, some Nigerian artistes, Dilo, Kasual, Tomzy, Jerry Jesu, FBI and Pupa Sunny have composed a song in the team’s honour. The spokesman for the artistes, Temitayo Otun,  popularly known as “Dilo’’ in an interview in Lagos said  the song entitled: “The Champions’’, was sponsored by the Nigeria Football Federation, Nigerian Supporters Club and a radio sports analyst, Effiong Nyong. Dilo Said: “The aim is for Super Eagles to know that Nigerians are behind them and that they should go and make the country proud. We need to encourage them; they are representing our country. All Nigerians need to encourage the team in one way or another; we need to pray for them; they are going for a battle on the field of football,’’ he said. He hoped that the song, which was produced by Sherriff would encourage the team to put in their best in the world cup and be the champions. According to him, the composers would do a  video clip of the song soon. Music producer, Cobhams Asuqo and music star, Innocent Idibia (2face) had produced “Power of Naija’’ in 2015 for Super Eagles. Austino Milado did “Super Eagles Carry Go’’ in 2009 for the national team.
