Alhaji Kabiru Turaki, a chieftain of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has called on Nigerians to support genuine efforts geared toward deepening democracy in the country. Turaki, a former Minister of Special Duties, made the call in Umuahia when he addressed the executive members and stakeholders of the party in Abia. “We believe in the rule of law. We must do everything to ensure that this democracy is not derailed,” he said. Turaki decried the spate of killings of innocent Nigerians across the country, ethnicity,  maladministration and corruption, saying such activities had become the order of the day. He said such activities were inimical to democracy and  urged Nigerians to be vigilant and elect credible leaders in 2019. “We have started a journey to reclaim our country and reclaim our future. Nigerians must rise to say that enough is enough. “We must be vigilant, otherwise, we will repeat a mistake that was made in 2015. We must be prepared to change what we do not like. “If we want to have peace, there must be justice. We must begin to talk to each other about certain critical national issues,” Turaki said. He condemned the alleged harassment of the President of the Senate, Dr Bukola Saraki, and his Deputy,  Sen.  Ike Ekweremadu,  by security agencies. He called on President Muhammadu Buhari to take urgent steps to forestall a repeat of such development. Turaki also spoke on the agitation for the restructuring of Nigeria, saying that restructuring could be addressed through regionalism, resource control and state police. In his speech, the state Chairman of PDP, Chief Johnson Onuigbo, thanked Turaki for identifying with the people of Abia. Onuigbo said that the 2019 general elections would offer Nigerians an opportunity to evolve a lasting solution to the challenges facing the nation.
