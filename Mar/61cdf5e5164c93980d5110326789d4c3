WorldStageNewsonlene--- Academic activities were today grounded at the IBB University Lapai, following a week warning strike embarked on  by the Academic Staff Union (ASUU)  of the institution. The one week warning strike is as a result of non payment of N530 million accrued academic allowances. ASSU Chairman of the institution, Dr Salahu Lawal, the said the strike was also a protest over other unresolved issues. ‎According to him, the union and Niger Government had agreed on the payment of the N530 million accrued allowances in January. “We had an understanding with the state government that from January 2018 they will start off setting the accrued allowances consecutively for a period of time. “We are telling Niger Government by this warning strike that they have reneged on the agreement we reached with them in August 2017 and this a breach. “This money is overdue and had accrued since 2009, nine years now’’ he said. ‎Lawal noted that such alleged breach of agreement would not augur well for the university which, he said, has shortage of manpower, infrastructure and basic amenities such as water and electricity. He claimed that the institution lacked basic needs for proper teaching and learning. ‎“We want to graduate students that will be at par with their international counterparts to compete with them comparatively.‎ ‎“We do not want to graduate students that will lag academically, psychologically, socially and otherwise. “Our graduates should be our ambassadors anywhere they find themselves, this is why we are striving for a better institution. ‎“Our utmost demand is a better teaching and learning environment to produce the desired graduates for Nigeria and the world.’’
