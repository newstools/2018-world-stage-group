The  Ekiti State Governor,  Ayodele Fayose has promised to submit himself to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) less than 24 hours after his hand-over day. Fayose who disclosed this on Wednesday faulted the speculations of his plan to escape EFCC arrest and investigation over alleged corruption cases pending before anti-graft agency. The governor stated this in a letter he personally signed and addressed to the EFCC, pledging to surrender himself on Oct. 16, the last day of his tenure. Fayose explained that his decision to make himself available to the EFCC was to clarify issues or answer questions on issues within his knowledge. In the letter addressed to the Chairman of EFCC, he said his desire to submit to the commission was consequent upon several and serial actions of the commission for some time now. These, he said included, but not limited to freezing of his accounts and attempts to secure temporary forfeiture of his properties. The governor said these were indicative of the commission’s desire to have him clarify some issues or answer some questions, but for the immunity he enjoyed under Section 308 of the 1999 Constitution as a serving governor. “I wish to inform you that my term of office pursuant to which I enjoy immunity against investigation and prosecution under the above provision shall lapse by effluxion of time on Monday, 15th October, 2018. “As a responsible citizen of our great country, who believes in the rule of law, I wish to inform you of my decision to make myself available in your office on Tuesday, 16th October 2018 at 1pm to clarify issues or answer questions within my knowledge. “Kindly confirm the suitability of the above date or indicate by return, the commission’s convenient date,” the letter read in part.
