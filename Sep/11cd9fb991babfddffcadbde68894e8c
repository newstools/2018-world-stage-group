WorldStage Newsonline– Commander Sector 3 Operation LAFIYA DOLE, Gen. Uwem Bassey has  lauded troops deployed at Gudumbali, Guzamala for gallantly  repelling Boko Haram  attack on the military base on Saturday. Some jihadists in gun trucks and various calibre of arms said to be from the Boko Haram faction under the leadership of Abu-Mosad Al-Barnawi, were reported to have stormed the town and engaged in fierce battle that lasted for many hours with the troops. Brig.-Gen. Texas Chukwu, Director Army Public Relation, who disclosed this in a statement in Maiduguri, said Bassey made the commendation during an assessment visit to Gundumbali. “The Commander urged the troops to continue to remain courageous while confronting the insurgents,”he said. Chukwu who provided more details of the incident, said that the insurgents who came to extort, terrorize law abiding citizens as well as to attack the military base in the town met a serious resistance by the gallant troops. He did not disclose the figure of casualty or injuries sustained from both parties during the attack. “The troops inflicted  overwhelming casualty on the terrorists due to superior fire power while some of the terrorists fled  to the fringes of Lake Chad,”he said. According to him, efforts are on by the troops to get other fleeing members of the terrorists group. He advised locals in the area to be vigilant and  carry out their legitimate businesses in their communities as well as  report any suspicious movements or activities to the nearest military base. The latest attack came just as about 2,000 IDPs comprising of 200 households were said to have returned to Guzamala to resettle and resume their traditional occupation of farming and fishing, as well as other socio-economic activities following relative peace.
