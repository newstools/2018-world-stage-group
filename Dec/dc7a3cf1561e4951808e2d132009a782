WorldStage Newsonline– Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Prof. Stephen Ocheni has appealed to Nigerian voters not to fall for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) antics and misrule again, saying only President Muhammadu Buhari could, for now, lead the country out of the woods. He made the appeal during the All Progressives Congress (APC)’s presidential rally at Anyigba, Kogi State. According to him, Buhari remains the most credible candidate among presidential candidates for the 2019 elections, and Nigerians should not to be deceived by the antics of PDP. Meanwhile, Balaraba Ibrahim Stegert, a former Senior Special Assistant to Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso on solid minerals, quit the PDP on Sunday. At the height of political intrigues in Kano State, Balaraba, a strong associate of Kwankwaso, decamped to the APC. After being retained as SA on solid minerals by the Umar Ganduje administration, Balaraba had resigned and reunited with erstwhile political godfather, Kwankwaso, in PDP. Meanwhile a civil society organisation, the Patriotic Conscience for New Nigeria, had previously lauded the performance of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo at the vice presidential debate, which held in Abuja on Friday, December 14. In a statement signed by its national coordinator, Salisu Mohammed Sani, the group stated that the Buhari/Osinbajo ticket remains the best option for Nigeria, given the myriads of achievements the present administration had recorded in the past three years.
