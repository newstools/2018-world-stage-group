Mission PinkCruise / Mission PinkVISSION, the initiatives aimed at taking wholistic preventive cancer and healthcare to the grassroots are set for launch in Lagos  Tuesday, December 4, 2018. According to a statement, the project was crucial given the fact that Nigeria now has the seventh lowest life expectancy in the world (down from eleventh lowest in 2014). Most Nigerians do not live to reap the fruit of their labour. “Cancer and its related risk factors are the major causes of untimely death in Nigeria. The global cancer burden has risen to 18.1 million new cases and 9.6 million cancer deaths in 2018 up from 14 million new cases and 8.8 million deaths in 2016,” the statement said. “To address this problem, mass medical mission (mmm) has deployed the pilot set of Mobile Cancer Centres (aka “the PinkCruise”) to take wholistic preventive healthcare to Nigerians. The eye-care aspect of Mission PinkCruise is known as Mission PinkVISSION, where “VISSION” stands for Voluntary Integrated Sight Saving Initiative Of Nigeria. “The PinkCruise is equipped with state-of-the-art facilities for screening and treatment (including mammography, endoscopy, colonoscopy, colposcopy, cryotherapy, laboratory, vaccination and surgeries for pre-cancer and early cancer). “The pilot phase of Mission PinkCruise is currently ongoing in Lagos, following a 12-months schedule which is available on the campaign website (pinkcruise.org). “To maximize the impact of Mission PinkCruise & Mission PinkVISSION, mmm / NCPP (National Cancer Prevention Programme) is set to launch a campaign, tagged … Health Education On The Go! This campaign involves the deployment of a fleet of special buses which are designed to combine provision of health education with public transportation.”
