The Federal Government has announced plan to provide support for Irish potato farmers thereby enhancing their productivity in the country. The National President, Potato Farmers Association of Nigeria (POFAN), Chief Daniel Okafor who stated this in  Abuja  said that the government had already put the association into its programme and ready to distribute disease-resistant seeds to the farmers. Okafor stressed the need for potato farmers to capture their data, including the size of their farm, location and the number of existing farmers. According to him, government is going to give every state what it deserves to increase potato production. “It is not going to be business as usual because farmers will be working with the Central Bank of Nigeria and Bank of Agriculture. “All the government is going to do is allocate certain amount of money to Irish potato value chain products, give farm inputs, tractors and create tractor-hiring centre in each local government. “Government does not want to manage it but ready to give stakeholders to encourage the farmers to form cooperative within them so as to access loans and farm inputs. “The company we are going to use will control the tractors as a centre. “In that centre, we will have people in-charge of mechanisation, all types of inputs, irrigation pump, disease control and anything that is going to help us,’’ he said. Okafor said that whenever farmers needed anything like fund and technical services, the centre would provide the support.
