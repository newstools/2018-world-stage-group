Nigeria’s Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, would be delivering the keynote address at the Christ Redeemers Friends International (CRFI), Middle East-UAE Chapter Professional Business Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Saturday, July 21, 2018. At the event, Prof Osinbajo would be addressing top corporate executives and international business organizations in the Middle East and Africa. The event, organised by the CRFI, Middle East-UAE Chapter, is aimed at exploring investment opportunities for corporate professionals and business organisations in the UAE and Nigeria. According to the organizers, “The event is also aimed at creating an environment for mutual interaction and opportunity to showcase the best of Nigeria in the current economic climate; and to project Nigeria’s business image abroad.” Under the Buhari administration, the country’s economy has made significant strides. The Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council, which is chaired by the Vice President, has been the driver of the Buhari administration’s Ease of Doing Business reforms, which have improved the country’s ranking in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Index 2017. It will be recalled that in the World Bank Doing Business index, Nigeria climbed up 24 places and was placed on the list of 10 most reformed economies globally. Also, the report noted that Nigeria made progress across several indicators comprising starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting credit, paying taxes and enforcing contracts.
