WorldStage Newsonline– Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yusuf Sulaimon Lasun has said that corrupt security operatives manning the ECOWAS highway along the Seme boarder were to blame for delays encountered by trans ECOWAS commuters. Lasun, who accused the security personnel at the border while responding to questions from fellow ECOWAS parliamentarians in Abuja at the ongoing Second Ordinary Session of the ECOWAS Parliament, said the corrupt practices in the discharge of their duties have resulted to delays witnessed by commuters on the said highway. The Deputy Speaker presented Nigeria’s report at the parliamentary retreat with members raising eyebrows on what they termed “unnecessary delays” caused by too many road blocks mounted by men of the Nigerian Police Force along the Seme border. A parliamentarian from Liberia alleged that the journey along that same route used to last for just thirty minutes, but that with increased security checks, some people ended up spending almost six hours. This according to him was “counter-productive for the entire community.” A Ghanaian parliamentarian also lamented incessant extortion of commuters on same border line by men of the Nigerian Police Force. He however acknowledged that the situation existed as a result of the heightening insecurity in Nigeria in particular and in the ECOWAS region in general. He urged the Nigerian parliamentarians to work closely with security agents to ease the stress travelers go through while using the said highway. Responding to issues raised by the parliamentarians, Lasun said “I think corruption is responsible for the problem…some of those police men are overzealous and corrupt.” He however promised that the Nigerian delegation would work assiduously with stakeholders to ameliorate the plight of community members affected by the menace.
