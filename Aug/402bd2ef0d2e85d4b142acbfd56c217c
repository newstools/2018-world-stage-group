WorldStage Newsonline– Boko Haram terrorists have killed a staff of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), John Lohpon Iliya in an attack on Garanda Village, Gudumbali area of Mobar Local Government Area of Borno State. NEMA Zonal Cordinator North-East, Mr Bashir Garga who confirmed the development said the staff was killed during an encounter between Nigerian troops and the insurgents on Wednesday. It was gathered that the terrorists also deployed shoulder-launched Rocket-propelled Grenade (RPG) during the attack which destroyed NEMA Excavators. Garga confirmed that they were going to retrieve the body of the deceased staff, saying, “The Director-General of NEMA, Mustapha Maihaja, has dispatched a team to colloborate with the military to facilitate the return of Iliya’s remains to the family. “The staff was actively involved in digging of trenches with NEMA excavators to protect liberated communities. “He was one of our finest rescuers who are involved in various activities in IDPS and liberated towns. We will surely miss him..” Mr Iliya is the latest victim of the Islamic insurgency that flared since 2009, killing more than 20,000 people and displacing up to 2.5 million residents of Nigeria’s North-east. The insurgents have been fighting at many fronts for almost a decade, in a bid to enforce a strict Islamic code in Northern Nigeria. The insurgents, whose activities have also been felt in Chad, Niger and Cameroon, have been packing punches regularly, hitting civilian targets and other soft spots in Nigeria’s North-east.
