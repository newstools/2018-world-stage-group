The Trade Union Congress of Nigeria joins its counterpart, the Southern African Trade Union Coordination Council (SATUCC), to strongly condemn the recent detention and disruption of peaceful demonstrations in the regional capitals of Zimbabwe scheduled to hold 11th October, 2018. The protest which was organized by the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), an arm of SATUCC represents 22 major federations in 14 of the 16 Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) member states with a combined membership of about 6 million working men and women. The information at our disposal is that ZCTU President, Comrade Peter Mutasa, the Secretary, General Japhet Moyo and over than 35 trade union activists have been arrested and physically assaulted in Harare and other major towns countrywide as police brutally moved in earlier yesterday to stop the planned nationwide protest by ZCTU and its general membership against the announced new tax regime, in particular the 2 percent tax on electronic transfers and the rising poverty. The Congress is worried that over 40 armed police officers have occupied the offices of the ZCTU since the incident and put all staff working in the building under house arrest. This is an action taken too far and we call on the Zimbabwean authority to stop the gross violation of fundamental workersâ€™ rights to organize, assemble and expression in Swaziland contrary to International Labour Organization Conventions 87 on Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize which the Government of Zimbabwe has ratified and has committed to uphold and implement. It is saddening that this is happening barely two months after the swearing- in of President Emerson Mnangagwa, who proclaimed a new dispensation for the people of Zimbabwe and promised a new dawn different from the previous administration of President Robert Mugabe which repeatedly violated workers rights with impunity. The TUC strongly condemns the action by the Government of Zimbabwe and demands that workers rights as well as human rights in general should be respected and upheld. It is the right of all workers and general public in Zimbabwe, and all affiliates of ZCTU to freely conduct trade union activities, defend and champion the rights of workers in Zimbabwe without restrictions and police brutality and harassment. We demand the immediate and unconditional release of all detained trade union leaders and activists including ZCTU President Peter Mutasa and Secretary General Japhet Moyo.
