Dr Charles Esekhaigbe, a medical practitioner, has urged men above the age of 40 to always check symptoms of Benign Prostatic Hyperphasia (BPH). Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) also called prostate gland enlargement, is a common condition in men, as they get older. An enlarged prostate gland can cause uncomfortable urinary symptoms, such as blocking the flow of urine out of the bladder. It can also cause bladder, urinary tract or kidney problems. Esekhaigbe told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the manifestation of BPH symptoms may not lead to prostate cancer in some cases, if treated instantly. He said that BPH condition was an inevitable state of every man above 40 years. “BPH begins to grow in every man from puberty depending on the age and it continues to increase with age and genealogy. “Certainly, you will begin to notice it after 40 years but that does not lead to prostate cancer in some cases depending on the person’s health condition,’’ the doctor said. Esekhaigbe, however, advised men at that particular age to seek advice from medical practitioners as soon as symptoms like urgency, hesitancy, urinary retention, are noticed when passing urine. NAN reports that Catholic Men Organisation (CMO), CKC Parish Kurudu, organised the medical outreach to ascertain the heath status of their members and encourage longer and healthier living. The chairman of CMO, Mr James Eva, said that the medical outreach was informed by the rampant mortality rate of members of the parish. He said that the medical outreach was imperative to checkmate and prevent the ratio at which men of the parish had died. According to Eva, many of the deaths are caused by ignorance and lack of knowledge of their health status. He also explained that the medical outreach was necessary because many people were not in the habit of visiting hospitals for regular medical checkup.
