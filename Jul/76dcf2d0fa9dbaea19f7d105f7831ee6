WorldStage Newsonline– More investments in quality education can curb the increasing rate of violence and insecurity in Nigeria, according to the Managing Director, Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC), Mr Umaru Ibrahim. Ibrahim said this in a statement issued by the Head, Communications and Public Affairs of NDIC, Mr Mohammed Ibrahim on Sunday in Abuja. The NDIC boss was quoted as making this remark while inaugurating a science laboratory built and equipped by the corporation for Zaria Academy, Shika in Kaduna State. Ibrahim said the inauguration of the laboratory, which was done during the schools 15th Graduation Ceremony of the Academy, was part of NDIC’s social responsibility initiative. He decried the upsurge of violent crimes and other challenges of insecurity, especially among the youths in the country. He expressed belief that the situation could be attributed to poor and weak educational system in the country. Ibrahim therefore called for concerted efforts from all stakeholders to guarantee qualitative education for millions of the nation’s youths to prepare them for gainful employment opportunities and better living conditions. The NDIC boss, while urging Nigerians to view the provision of quality education as the responsibility of all, described the complete reliance on governments as retrogressive. He therefore called on the private sector to compliment government efforts. He said the resources available to government could not provide the type of education required to produce graduates that were not only employable but also adaptable to the rapidly changing global economy. The NDIC boss noted the low rate of Senior Secondary School enrollment and low standard of education in the Northern states must be discouraged. He therefore called on governors in the region to improve the educational standards of their states, adding that scholarships should be offered to bright indigent students.
