WorldStage Newsonline– The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) said it won’t be surprised to hear such desperate allegation from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) that President Buhari has sold the buildings in Aso Rock to the Israelis or Americans as the Atiku Campaign continues to fall apart on a daily basis. The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, has been making wild allegations about President Muhammadu Buhari, says the Buhari Campaign Organisation. Atiku has demanded an investigation into the alleged ownership of Keystone Bank and Etisalat by Buhari’s family. However, a statement by the Buhari Campaign Organization said “the latest revelation that the said shares are rather linked to relatives of Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, it has become a case of the thief calling the farm owner the thief, as the Yorubas would say in a popular proverb. “These impending wild allegations would naturally border on corrupt practices without any evidential basis. “The purpose is to attempt to dent the greatest forte of the President and Vice President going into 2019 elections, which is their personal integrity. The latest tactics of the main opposition is premised on the following grounds: The foundation for the challenges in these sectors, are firmly rooted in their 16 years of disastrous governance. President Buhari has just started a re-building process.” It added that “Whilst the President and Vice President are prepared and willing to answer any genuine inquiry raised about their stewardship, Nigerians should always ask the critical questions as to “where”, “when”, “how”, names, dates, addresses, etc in respect of any allegation raised by the opposition before giving any credence to it.
