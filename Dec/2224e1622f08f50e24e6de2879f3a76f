WorldStage Newsonline– A  former National Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party, Prof. Wale Oladipo, has said that though the vote of the South West is sure for the People Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, the aggrieved members of the party must be placated for it to happen. Oladipo, who is  a member of the PDP Presidential Campaign Council, in a statement on the South West PDP presidential rally, described Atiku as a tested and trusted presidential material having being a Vice President for eight years. He assured that the South West would vote massively for Atiku in the February 2019 presidential election. He said with his wealth of experience, Atiku would run an all-inclusive, liberal and God-fearing government after winning the 2019 election. Oladipo, however, urged leaders and members of the National Working Committee, to ensure total reconciliation of aggrieved parties in the zone to ensure total victory for the party. He said, “I commend the good work of members of the  NWC of our party in their efforts to make the PDP  regain its lost glory. “I will also want the body, the Board of Trustees and other prominent leaders of the party to ensure a total reconciliation in the zone and others in general in order for it to make a successful outing in all the 2019 general elections. “This has become necessary so that we can go into the 2019 election battle as a united front. Once this is done, victory is assured. We need total reconciliation and it should be now.”
