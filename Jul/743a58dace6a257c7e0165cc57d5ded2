WorldStage Newsonline– The All Progressives Congress (APC) has chided the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) over alleged antics of seeking a new coalition and the desperate shopping for members ahead the 2019 elections. The APC in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Malam Bolaji Abudullahi said that instead of doing all that, the PDP should face the Nigerian electorate on its own merit. According to the statement, after three years of defeat, the PDP is understandably excited with the possibility of hiding its “irredeemably bad image under the heap of a new coalition”. It said that like the vulture, PDP saw every altercation as a potential opportunity for a feast, alleging conspiracies and threatening to boycott elections. It also accused the party of announcing fake defections. “What is clear with all these is that no matter how long a leopard lives, it cannot change its spots. “What President Muhammadu Buhari and Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, our National Chairman, are doing, persuading every aggrieved member not to leave the party, is what responsible and sensible party leaders would do,” it said. The APC pointed out that party politics was a game of number. It, however, noted that if the PDP had the same presence of mind in 2015, perhaps the calamity that befell it, would have been averted.
