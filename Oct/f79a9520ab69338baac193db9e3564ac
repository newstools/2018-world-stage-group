China has reported African swine fever outbreaks in many provinces, but the situation is generally under control, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said on Thursday. “As the country intensified prevention and control of the disease since the first outbreak was discovered in August, all the outbreaks have been effectively addressed. “The quarantine has been lifted in 12 affected regions,’’ the ministry added. African swine fever is a highly contagious, viral disease that infects pigs. It does not affect humans or other animal species. Over 4,000 cases of the disease have been reported in 14 other countries this year, and the massive outbreaks in neighbouring countries pose a great risk of the disease crossing into China. However, the situation remained grave. The ministry said it would continue to take measures to prevent the disease from spreading further, including enhancing monitoring of live pig transportation and tightened entry inspection and quarantine.
