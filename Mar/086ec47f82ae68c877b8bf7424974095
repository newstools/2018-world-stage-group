WorldStageNewsonlene--- Sokoto State Govonor,  Aminu Tambuwal has expressed shock  over high interest rates charged on small scale businesses in the country. The Governor who disclosed this in Sokoto  when he received the Managing Director of the United Bank for Africa (UBA) Plc, Mr Ken Uzoka in his office appealed to financial institutions to review downwards the interest rates charged on small scale businesses in order to fast track their growth. He said the prevailing interest rates being  charged by banks were  hurting small businesses in the country and should be reviewed downwards to enhance growth and economic stability. The governor said  the high interest rates  had  been denying many individuals and small-holder entities access to loans, thereby limiting their ability to expand. “I want to urge banks in the country, and especially the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), to look into this problem because many small and medium scale enterprises have gone under due to lack of access to finance. “The ones that have struggled to stay afloat find it hard to expand. So the banks should look inwards and introduce policies that will, at the end, provide a win-win situation for them and their customers. “I am not saying you should give loans that are not sustainable, but within the operating environment, a common ground could be reached that will help to stimulate growth in the economy,” Tambuwal said. The governor added that the Sokoto State Government had  long standing relationship with UBA Plc, adding that  his administration would  continue to explore avenues  to enhance it. He commended the bank for its corporate social engagements in the state while appealing for more interventions. In his remarks, Uzoka said his organisation had  impacted positively on the lives of many through its 3Es intervention bordering on  education, environment and empowerment.
