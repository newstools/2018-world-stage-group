WorldStage Newsonline– The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Abubakar Atiku has said President Muhammadu Buhari was simply out to blackmail the duo of businessmen Aliko Dangote and Femi Otedola by including them in the ruling All Progressives Party (APC) Presidential Campaign Council. Dangote and Otedola were, on Friday, included in the party’s campaign team as advisers for next year’s polls. But Atiku said the president would only turn around and call them corrupt businessmen by the time they fund his campaign. According to him, such persons should have been drafted in the country’s economic team to revamp the ailing economy. “These people are businessmen, not politicians,” Atiku noted in the statement. “These are the kind of people Nigerians expect to see in the economic management team because of what they have done for this country. “He (Buhari) is simply out to blackmail them because, by the time they fund his campaign, he will turn around and call them corrupt businessmen.” In addition, he stated that “Nigerians can now see for themselves what we have been talking about all this while and we call on them to vote out this grossly incompetent administration, whose stock in trade is blackmail of perceived enemies. “The All Progressives Congress (APC) included businessmen Aliko Dangote and Femi Otedola in its 2019 presidential campaign council due to desperation.” The presidency had earlier explained the inclusion of the businessmen on the campaign team, noting that they are not members of the party. And while reacting to this development, Atiku stated via his campaign spokesman, Kassim Afegbua, that such move was anti-people.
