As part of efforts to eliminate revenue diversion and ensure transparency, the Edo Government says it is planning to introduce the use of scratch cards as a mode of collecting revenues in the transport sector. The Deputy Governor, Mr Philip Shaibu, said this when he received state officials of the Nigeria Association of Road Transport Owners NARTO in Benin on Tuesday. He expressed optimism that the new system would also ease the process of revenue payment. Shaibu explained that the process would have a tracking system that would ensure remittance of all monies collected to government coffers and completely eliminate extortion. He thanked the association for its activities in the state. Shaibu urged officials of the association to study the harmonised revenue bill to see areas they could partner with the state government. Earlier, the Chairman of the association, Mr Anthony Oziegbe, said officials of the association were at the Government House to see areas of possible partnership with the state government. He said that the association was currently partnering with the Federal Government in road repairs across the country.
