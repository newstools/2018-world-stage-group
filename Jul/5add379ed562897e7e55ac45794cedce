WorldStage Newsonline– Nigeria’s Ministry of Finance has confirmed distribution of N668.898 billion as the federation allocation for May figures to the three tiers of government pending the resolution of the disagreement that led to the rejection of the fund when due last month. Owing to disagreement on remittances by the Revenue Generating Agencies, especially the NNPC, the sharing of revenues for May 2018 that was meant to be distributed in June 2018, was put on hold. A statement from the  Ministry of Finance said the urgent need to cushion the undue hardships being experienced by workers nationwide made it necessary to distribute the fund while efforts are being intensified to address the unsatisfactory remittances.
