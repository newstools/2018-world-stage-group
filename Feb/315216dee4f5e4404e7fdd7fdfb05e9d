WorldStage Newsonline--- The management of Nigeria Railway Corporation (NRC) has expressed confidence in the ability of the proposed electronic ticketing to curb racketeering in the industry. NRC Lagos District Manager, Mr Jerry Oche who disclosed this on Thursday said the introduction of the e-ticketing will curb the challenges of racketeering and enhance better management of the sector. “I won’t tell you that racketeering is not happening, but what we do is that we investigate and discover where its coming from. Definitely, if we introduce the system, it will curb it because of the unique system involved, which makes it difficult to forge,” he said. The district manager said that the corporation, in an effort to eradicate the menace of racketeering, had earlier changed the ticket from its former card-like form to the present one being used. He said the corporation was not only planning for e-ticketing but also working towards providing internet services in the train, combined with GPRS to track the movement of trains at any point in time. “ In fact, we have lots of proposals concerning those projects from different stakeholders in the sector,” Oche said. He said the development would bring advancement to the system and allow effective operations. Mr Fidet Okhiria, Managing Director, NRC, had said that plans were underway to commence web-based ticketing for the Abuja-Kaduna rail line. Okhiria said that the software concerning the project was being developed, and would reduce the challenge of overbooking of passengers.
