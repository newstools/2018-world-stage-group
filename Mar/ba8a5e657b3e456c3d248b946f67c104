Taiwo also said that the 82-kilometre Nasarawa-Loko road,  linking the bridge to both states, would be completed by September to facilitate movement. “I want to assure that this particular bridge and the Nasarawa-Loko road are very important projects to the Federal Government. Our target is November and we hope by then, it will be ready for use,“he said.
