The bill, tagged “Budget of Consolidation,” has a Capital Expenditure outlay of N71.7 billion, representing 51.4 per cent, and Recurrent Expenditure of N67.8 billion, representing 48.6 per cent. Ikpeazu said on Friday that the budget outlay was slightly less than that of 2018, which was N140. 9 billion.

Responding, the Speaker of the house, Mr Chikwendu Kalu, promised that the house would give prompt attention to the budget estimate.

We are in this together.” Meanwhile, the house also on Friday passed a Supplementary Appropriation Bill of over N9.8 billion, presented to it by the governor for the year ending December 31, 2018.
