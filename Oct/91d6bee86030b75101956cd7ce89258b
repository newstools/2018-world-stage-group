Speaking on the choice of the theme, GOCOP President, Dotun Oladipo, said: “The prevailing economic, political and security realities in Nigeria require keen interest from the media. “With the 2019 general elections approaching, Nigerians deserve access to authentic news and views, which are best provided through digital platforms upon which GOCOP members operate. “As an organisation, GOCOP is committed to ensuring that the use of fake news and misinformation do not destroy Nigeria’s political, economic and security progress, hence the need to look at the critical role of online publishers as entrusted to them by the Constitution.” The Newspapers Proprietors Association of Nigeria (NPAN), Broadcasting Organisations of Nigeria (BON), Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE), Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ) and other stakeholder groups in the media will be represented at the conference. GOCOP represents media organisations registered in Nigeria with promoters drawn from practitioners who have served at senior levels in the profession.
