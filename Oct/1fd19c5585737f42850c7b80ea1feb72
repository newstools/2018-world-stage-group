The ongoing trial of the accused Kidnap Kingpin, Chukwudumeme Onwuamadike, also known as Evans before a Lagos High Court in Igbosere was on Monday stalled by the absence of his lawyer, Mr Olarenwaju Ajanaku. Evans is currently facing two separate charges on conspiracy to kidnap, kidnapping and attempted murder, before Justice Adedayo Akintoye. In the first charge, Evans is standing trial alongside Joseph Emeka, Ugochukwu Nwachukwu and Victor Aduba. In the second charge, he is standing trial alongside Joseph Emeka, Linus Okpara and Victor Aduba. At the resumed hearing on Monday, a letter written by Evans counsel,  Ajanaku, was presented to the court. The Prosecutor, Mr Adeniji Kazeem SAN, informed the court that he got a letter from Ajanaku stating that he would not be available in court. The  reason for the counsel’s absence was not mentioned in the court. However, Justice Akintoye, adjourned the case until Oct. 24 for further hearing. At the last hearing on Oct. 4, a fifth prosecution witness, Izuchukwu Ezeuko, had told the court how he traveled to the Eastern part of the country to drop one million dollars ransom to the alleged kidnappers of his employer. Ezeuko, a manager in the firm of the victim of the alleged kidnap, Mr James Uduji, had made the revelation while giving evidence before the court. He had also told the court that he agreed to travel from Lagos to the east to drop the ransom, to save his boss. Ezeuko narrated to the court how he paid one million-dollar ransom in two trenches of 800, 000 and 200,000 dollars to the kidnappers of his employer. The witness was led in evidence by the Attorney-General and Commissioner of Justice Lagos State, Mr Adeniji Kazeem, SAN.
