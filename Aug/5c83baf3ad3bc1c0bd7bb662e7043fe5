Twenty-three members of the 24-member Kwara House of Assembly, including all principal officers on Wednesday defected From All Progressive Congress (APC) to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The defection, according to Speaker of the assembly, Dr Ali Ahmad, during plenary was conveyed in a letter written to the House by the Majority Leader, Mr Hassan Oyeleke, on behalf of concerned members. All the defected members were in the APC and the only member remaining in the party is Saheed Popoola, representing Ojomu-Balogun Constituency in Offa Local Government Area. Each of the 23 members, including the speaker, signed the letter of the defection. In his remarks, Ahmad said that the movement to the PDP by the 23 lawmakers became imperative “since the APC has failed to meet the aspirations of Nigerians”. He alleged that the APC-led Federal Government was harassing and intimidating top government functionaries instead of tackling the problem confronting the nation. “In 2014, l was terribly sad leaving PDP reluctantly with 36 members of the then House of the Representatives. Today, l am the happiest man leaving APC for good. “l wish l was never a member of that party,’’ the speaker said. He directed all the defectors to urgently consult the electorate in their various constituencies of the development. The speaker announced the removal of Popoola, the only APC member in the House as Chairman, House Committee on information, Youth and Sports. The members replace Popoola with Abdulrahman Abdulrafiu, representing llorin North West constituency.
