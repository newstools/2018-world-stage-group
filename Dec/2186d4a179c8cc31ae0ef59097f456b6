WorldStage Newsonline– If agitation for Biafra independence will stop Igbo people to elect leaders who will serve them selflessly, a member representing Aba North/Aba South in the House of Representatives, Ossy Prestige has said. Prestige, a lawmaker on the platform of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), made this known in Aba on Thursday in an interview with newsmen in Aba, Abia State. The lawmaker, noting that people were always forced to seek alternatives through agitations when their representatives are not giving them what they expected from them, said the political solution to the agitation for Biafra is for Igbo people to elect leaders who will serve them selflessly. Prestige, therefore, urged the Igbo to come out en masse and vote for credible candidates who have the mind to serve them rather than voting based on sentiments and material inducements. “The refusal of some Igbo people to carry out their civic responsibilities will not resolve the issue of marginalisation which resulted in the revived agitation for Biafra,” he said. He enjoined the Igbo in positions of leadership to seek the welfare of their people rather than enthroning selfish interests that rob the people of their dues through their representatives. Prestige, who noted that although he was facing a troubling opposition from the PDP-led state government in Abia, said he was not in competition and cannot compete with them. The lawmaker, however, vowed that nothing would stop his resolve to free his constituents from their real enemies.
