WorldStage Newsonline-- Potential investors that have gotten licences to build refineries in Nigeria are not getting the necessary funding from the local banks, a development that have hindered the actual take off of many projects, according to an industry operator. Chairman, Integrated Oil and Gas Ltd, Capt Emmanuel Iheanacho in an interview said his company along with others were facing paucity of funds as local banks were not willing to fund their projects over fears about local capacity to manage them. “We have proved to possess the technical competence and engineering capabilities, yet finance is a major problem here,” he said. His company is promoting a 20,000 barrel per day Eko Refinery and Petrochemical at Tomaro Island Port, Amuwo Odofin Local Government Area, Lagos at a projected cost of $250 million. Ihenacho said the government can assist him and other potential investors by compelling the banks to grant them loans. Specifically, he said, the Federal Government should come up with a policy framework that will compel financial institutions to make funds available to indigenous players who might intend to build modular refineries. He said,  “Financial support is one major area we need government’s help, if government realises that there is need to have a lot of the small scale refineries to turn around the economy. “We are not asking to be given grants and handout but to be assisted in the process of being able to secure financing in major finance institutions.”
