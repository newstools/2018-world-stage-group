WorldStage Newsonline– The Military Pensions Board (MPB) has debunked the rumours making the round that the Military Pension Board operatives were demanding money from relatives of deceased personnel of the military forces to facilitate the process of payment of their entitlements. Describing rumour as fake, fraudulent, malicious and mischievous, the board said the allegation was designed by impostors to defraud retired colleagues and their families of their hard earned income. The Board also advised pensioners and families of deceased military personnel not only to avoid such impostors but also to promptly report such to the nearest military unit. It recalled that the Chairman of the Board, Major General Ahmadu Bala Adamu on assumption of command clearly prioritized prompt and efficient payment of all pensions and entitlements of deceased personnel as his vision. The vision, according to the board, included institutionalizing a seamless, inclusive process which did not require use of any third party to facilitate payment. It added that all outstanding payments, arrears and entitlements of deceased military personnel were being promptly processed at the board. The board cautioned those it called the impostors that measures were in place to track, apprehend and decisively deal with any individual attempting to swindle pensioners. “The full weight of the law will be brought upon any person(s) and their accomplices caught in this nefarious act,” it added.
