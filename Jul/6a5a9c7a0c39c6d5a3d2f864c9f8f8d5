Kenya’s economy is likely to expand by 6.2 per cent this year, the central bank’s governor, Patrick Njoroge, said on Tuesday. Njoroge told a news conference in Nairobi that the forecast was based on the economy’s performance in the first quarter, a stronger agriculture sector and a jump in tourists’ forward bookings. The apex bank outlook offers a rosier outlook than the finance ministry, which expects growth of 5.8 per cent.
